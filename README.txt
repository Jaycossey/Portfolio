            -- Project Manada --

        Description:
            
            Project Manada is the starting point for my programming career, it will contain my portfolio website and ensure that I document both my 
            personal and professional development. My motivation is to continually improve and better my programming skills and learn how to approach
            different projects and problems in an algorithmic way of thinking and be able to tackle any potential challenge that I face in the future.

            I aim to learn more in many different fields of programming, beginning in Web development as a front end developer and working my way towards
            working in game development as a full stack developer. This portfolio is my way of documenting where I started and where I will end up.  

        Current and planned projects:

            Portfolio Website 
                - The main focus of the project is to demonstrate and show my programming skills, as well as hosting some of the projects within this 
                  as portfolio pieces. 

            Settlement Generator    
                - This project was a practice piece for OOP, I wanted to learn and demonstrate fetch requests, Math.random, string manipulation, arrays 
                  and creating characters to populate a settlement based on different criteria that the User defines.

            Dethklok Quote machine  
                - This was a certification project that I didn't quite realise needed to call an API for random quotes, it calls at random from an arrays
                  of quotes and authors from the TV series Metalocalypse.

            Enigma machine  
                - This project idea was built upon the ceaser cypher program I wrote and thoroughly enjoyed. The enigma machine itself was a very complex
                  encryption process but coding one myself is something I really enjoyed the thought of and wanted to add this to my portfolio as an 
                  educational piece as well as a challenge for myself.

            Canvas animations   
                - This is leaning into my personal interest in game development, after learning how to create spritesheets and building upon those, 
                  eventually I aim to have a full game created with the 2d sprites and add that to this portfolio.
