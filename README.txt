            -- Project Manada --

        Description:
            
            Project Manada is the starting point for my programming career, it will contain my portfolio website and ensure that I document both my 
            personal and professional development. 

        Current and planned projects:

            Portfolio Website 
                - The main focus of the project is to demonstrate and show my programming skills, as well as hosting some of the projects within this 
                  as portfolio pieces. 

            Settlement Generator    
                - This project was a practice piece for OOP, I wanted to learn and demonstrate fetch requests, Math.random, string manipulation, arrays 
                  and creating characters to populate a settlement based on different criteria that the User defines.
